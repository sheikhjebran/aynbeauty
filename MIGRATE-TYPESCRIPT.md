# 🚀 AynBeauty Production Deployment - TypeScript Migration

## 📋 Quick Deployment Steps

### 1. Install TypeScript Migration Dependencies

```bash
npm install tsx --save-dev
```

### 2. Set Up Environment for Migration

```bash
# Copy production environment template to local env file
cp .env.production .env.local

# Edit .env.local with your actual database credentials
nano .env.local  # or use your preferred editor
```

**Required Environment Variables in `.env.local`:**
```env
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_PORT=3306
DB_NAME=aynbeauty
DB_USER=your_actual_mysql_username
DB_PASSWORD=your_actual_mysql_password
```

### 3. Run TypeScript Database Migration

```bash
# Run the automated database migration
npm run migrate:production
```

This will:
- ✅ Connect to your MySQL database
- ✅ Create the `aynbeauty` database if it doesn't exist
- ✅ Execute all table creation statements
- ✅ Insert sample data and admin user
- ✅ Verify the migration was successful
- ✅ Show database statistics

### 4. Deploy Application

After successful database migration:

```bash
# Build the application for production
npm run build

# Start with PM2 (if available)
pm2 start ecosystem.config.js

# Or start with Node.js directly
npm start
```

## 🔧 Migration Script Features

### Automatic Database Creation
- Creates database with proper UTF8MB4 charset
- Handles existing database gracefully
- Sets proper MySQL optimizations

### Smart Error Handling
- Continues on duplicate/exists errors
- Provides detailed error reporting
- Validates environment configuration

### Migration Verification
- Counts created tables
- Verifies admin user creation
- Checks sample data insertion
- Reports migration statistics

### Environment Integration
- Reads from `.env.local` automatically
- Validates required credentials
- Supports all standard MySQL configurations

## 📊 Migration Output Example

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### Connection Errors
```bash
# If you get connection errors, check:
1. MySQL server is running
2. Credentials in .env.local are correct
3. User has proper permissions
4. Database server allows connections
```

### Permission Errors
```bash
# Grant proper permissions to your MySQL user:
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* TO 'your_user'@'localhost';
GRANT CREATE ON *.* TO 'your_user'@'localhost';
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
```

### Migration Verification Failed
```bash
# Check individual table creation:
mysql -u your_user -p aynbeauty -e "SHOW TABLES;"

# Check for specific errors:
mysql -u your_user -p aynbeauty -e "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM users;"
```

## 🎯 Advantages of TypeScript Migration

### vs Manual MySQL Command:
- ❌ `mysql -u username -p < deploy-production-db.sql`
- ✅ `npm run migrate:production`

### Benefits:
1. **No Manual Credential Entry** - Reads from `.env.local`
2. **Automatic Error Handling** - Smart error recovery
3. **Migration Verification** - Confirms successful deployment
4. **Environment Integration** - Works with your existing config
5. **Detailed Logging** - See exactly what's happening
6. **Cross-Platform** - Works on Windows, Linux, macOS

## 🚀 Production Deployment Workflow

```bash
# 1. Set up environment
cp .env.production .env.local
# Edit .env.local with your credentials

# 2. Install dependencies
npm install

# 3. Run database migration
npm run migrate:production

# 4. Build application
npm run build

# 5. Deploy (choose one):
# Option A: PM2
pm2 start ecosystem.config.js

# Option B: Direct Node.js
npm start

# Option C: Docker (if using containers)
docker-compose up -d
```
